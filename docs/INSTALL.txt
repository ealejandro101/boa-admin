 ------------------------------------------------
 
 1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
 
	To be able to run this system on your webserver, it must have PHP 7 or higher running,
	and you must have an FTP access to upload the files on the server. 
	
	That's all! No database is needed.
 
 2 QUICK INSTALL
 
 	a. Download or clone boa-project source to a folder the installation server 
 	(git clone https://github.com/boa-project/boa.git [installation-folder])
 	
 	b. Locate and copy [installation-folder]/src/boa/conf/bootstrap_context.php.sample file in new file named bootstrap_context.php 
	Then change in new file the variable 
 	ADMIN_PASSWORD to the password you want to set for the admin user on first run, default value is admin.
 	
 	c. Locate [installation-folder]/src/boa/conf/bootstrap_repositories.php,
 	make sure all the paths for the configured repositories exists. 
 	
 	d. Make sure [installation-folder]/src/data and its children folders are writeable
 	by apache user (e.g. chown -R www [installation-folder]/src/data)
 	
 	e. Create a virtual directory pointing to [installation-folder]/src and, 
 	reload apache then navigate to the configure virtual directory on your preferred 
 	browser. Follow the installation wizard.
 	
	f. Copy the [installation-folder]/src.htaccess.sample file to [installation-folder]/src.htaccess and modify the RewriteBase parameter
	(e.g. RewriteBase /boa-admin  or RewriteBase /boa its depends your domain configuration)
 	
 
 2 FURTHER CONFIGURATION
 
	Refer [installation-folder]/src/boa/conf/bootstrap_conf.php file for additional configuration options.
 
 2.1 WORKSPACES
    
	A workspace is a folder that you want to browse/modify with the application. 
	A workspace does not have to be inside the installation folder, since you set
	it with an absolute path on your server.
   
	You can set as many workspaces as you want : you will be able to switch from one
	to another when logged in, and you can precisely set rights for each
	users (see paragraph 2.2) on each workspace.
    
    By default, the basic workspace is set to the "files" folder inside the [installation-folder]/src/data. 
    You can change it to whatever you want, using absolute path 
    like : /home/login/www/location, or /C:/myfolder/ on windows by editing the [installation-folder]/src/boa/conf/bootstrap_repositories.php file.
    
    Note that a workspace does not have to be accessible to the internet, The application will
    work as a "proxy" between your files and the web.
    
 2.2 USERS MANAGEMENT
    
    An evoluted users management system has been developed in the application. You are encouraged 
    to use it to secure your data, but it's up to you, you can disable it totally (for example 
    if you are already working in a very secure zone, and don't need any users profiles).
    
    If you are a beginner, just change the ADMIN_PASSWORD variable before uploading on your 
    server everything should be fine. If you do not change it, you will be reminded to change 
    the first time you log in, because otherwise anybody knowing this application could login with 
    the standard initial password "admin"...
    
    You can add / modify / delete users by logging in as "admin" and clicking on 
    "Settings" button. For each user, you will be able to give read and/or right access separately 
    on each workspace. Note that a user that has no rights on any workspace cannot log in.
    
    For a better integration in existing systems, The application can "prelog" a user from external 
    data or logging system. Users must still be created in the application, since their rights on 
    repositories and preferences are stored by the application. But they will not be able to 
    change their password, since they are in that case managed by an external application.
    
    2.2.1 BASIC USERS CONFIGURATION
    	
    	ENABLE_USERS => 1 	Users management is enabled
    					0 	Users management is totally disabled. No logging required and all 
    						users share the same preferences.
    					
    	ALLOW_GUEST_BROWSING => 1 	In the "Settings" console accessed by admin user, 
    								a "guest" user is created on which you can set 
    								rights on repositories like any other user. This 
    								user will be automatically logged in if no user 
    								is identified.
    							0 	When no user is identified, the login screen appears 
    								and no workspace is loaded.

	2.2.2 AUTHENTICATION METHOD
	
	Authentication is (like the repositories as access and the configuration )
	plugin-based. By default, in the conf.php file you can see that the basic auth.serial plugin 
	is used to manage your users. This means that the users and their rights and personnal data 
	will be stored on the filesystem, in a specific format. This plugin is the most
	performant, but may not be suited for managing a huge amount of users, or when managing users
	already created in an external system like a CMS. In that case, you should have a look at the auth.ldap
	or auth.remote plugins, or even auth.mysql, each of these plugin giving you more features for 
	managing plugin.
